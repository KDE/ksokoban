<P>This game was originally invented in Japan in the early 80's and won a
computer game contest there. &quot;Sokoban&quot; is japanese for
&quot;warehouse keeper&quot;. The idea is that you are a warehouse
keeper trying to push crates to their proper locations in a warehouse.
<P>
<P>The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step over them. If
you are not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong places
and/or block your way.
<P>
<P>It can be rather difficult just to solve a level. But if you want to make
it even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves and/or pushes
you use to solve the level.
<P>
<P>To make the game more fun for small kids (below 10 years or so), some
collections with easier levels are also included in ksokoban. These
are marked <B>(easy)</B> in the level colletion menu. Of course,
these levels can be fun for adults too, for example if you don't want
to expose yourself to too much mental strain.
