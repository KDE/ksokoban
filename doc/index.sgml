<sect>Introduction
<p>
This game was originally invented in Japan in the early 80's and won a
computer game contest there. &dquot;Sokoban&dquot; is japanese for
&dquot;warehouse keeper&dquot;. The idea is that you are a warehouse
keeper trying to push crates to their proper locations in a warehouse.

<p>
The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step over them. If
you are not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong places
and/or block your way.

<p>
It can be rather difficult just to solve a level. But if you want to make
it even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves and/or pushes
you use to solve the level.

<p>
To make the game more fun for small kids (below 10 years or so), some
collections with easier levels are also included in ksokoban. These
are marked <bf>(easy)</bf> in the level colletion menu. Of course,
these levels can be fun for adults too, for example if you don't want
to expose yourself to too much mental strain.

<sect>How to play
<p>
The objective of the game is to push all the red gems to the goal
squares, which are marked with green glassy round things on the floor.

<p>
Use the cursor keys or the mouse to move about. If you move onto a gem
using the cursor keys or the middle mouse button, and there is noting
blocking it on the opposite side, then you will push the gem.  It
isn't possible to pull the gems, so if you push a gem into a corner it
will be stuck there. You can't step over the gems either, so you can
also get trapped in a part of the maze by blocking the way with gems.
Also note that it isn't possible to push more than one gem at a time.

<p>
If you notice that you have moved the gems in such a way that the
level is impossible to solve, then you can always use the undo feature
to go back to a position where the mistake has not yet been made. You
can of course also restart the level from the very beginning.
