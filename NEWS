version 0.2.2: Date 1998-11-06

* Bugfix: "Animation off" now works again

* Possibly fixed bug: Settings should now always be saved properly
	I haven't been able to reproduce this bug, but it has been reported
	that the settings would sometimes not be saved to the right section
	in the config file. Thanks to Tore Skaug <toresk@pvv.ntnu.no> for
	reporting this.

* Now uses the zlib check in acinclude

version 0.2.1: Date 1998-10-25

* Bugfix: Fixed failed assertion that showed up if you changed to small
          graphics and restarted the game.
          Thanks to Bernd Weber <bernd.weber@systemhaus.net> for reporting
          this.

* No longer requires zlib. It is still used if found, though.

version 0.1.2: ksokoban imported to CVS. Date 1998-08-30

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version 0.1.1: bugfix release. Date 1998-08-25

* BUGFIX: ksokoban now ignores mouseclicks while a move is in progress.
	  Previously such a click would cause a memory leak and a corrupted
	  undo/redo history (or a failed assertion if debugging was turned on).
	  Thanks to Natali Giuliano <natali@stone.trew.it> for reporting this.

* ksokoban should now work with older zlib & Qt libraries.
  I have tested it with zlib 1.0.3 and Qt 1.33

* Detects the old gcc 2.7 and turns off optimisations if it is found.
  It might work with the gcc 2.7 now. No promises, though.
  I can only test it with gcc 2.8 and egcs/pgcc.
