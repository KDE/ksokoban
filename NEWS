version 0.1.1: bugfix release. Date 1998-08-25

* BUGFIX: ksokoban now ignores mouseclicks while a move is in progress.
	  Previously such a click would cause a memory leak and a corrupted
	  undo/redo history (or a failed assertion if debugging was turned on).
	  Thanks to Natali Giuliano <natali@stone.trew.it> for reporting this.

* ksokoban should now work with older zlib & Qt libraries.
  I have tested it with zlib 1.0.3 and Qt 1.33

* Detects the old gcc 2.7 and turns off optimisations if it is found.
  It might work with the gcc 2.7 now. No promises, though.
  I can only test it with gcc 2.8 and egcs/pgcc.
